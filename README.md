# Earthquake_Challenge
The goal of this project is to create an interactive, dynamic map that will reflect earthquake activity in the last 7 days. 

### Map description
*The map can be accessed in three different versions: street, satellite, and dark.
*The map can show three different sets of data; 
	*tectonic plates, where earthquakes might be expected to originate
	*all earthquakes occurring over the past 7 days
	*major earthquakes occurring over the past 7 days. 
	
*The information and map formats are accessed by using the toggle in the upper right hand corner of the map. 

*When clicked, the circle markers on the map reveal a pop up giving specfic data about location and magnitude of the earthquake acrtivity. .
